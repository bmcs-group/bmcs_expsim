2020-12-19 [RC]

1. To verify that the model reproduces the results obtained 
   on a single material point level, design a unit cube
   discretization and load it exactly in the same way
   as reported in Fig.11a of the MS1 paper. Use the 
   material parameters for C40 provided in paper in Table 4.
   
   Implemented in notebook: [cct01_cube_3d.ipynb](cct02_unit_cube_3d.ipynb)

2. Define a axisymmetric model with unit area and height
   and use the same material parameters as above. Exactly
   the same respponse must be obtained before further steps
   can be taken.
